Rules Geocoder provides a geocoding action for the Rules module.
You can specify one or more CCK text fields that will be concatenated
and geocoded using the Google Maps API (v3). The result is then saved in an
OpenLayer CCK WKT field. 

Since the module is intended to be used instead of the regular
OpenLayers CCK map widget, an "Open Layers Hidden Value" widget is
provided that hides it from the node form.
